### `v2.2`


If you focus on the window open (in your taskbar), you can now press keys to activate/toggle different features. Here is a list of them:

`TAB`           - Toggle different values (Cursor Position, RGB, HEX, CYMK, HSL)
`CTRL+C`/`C`    - Copy value to clipboard
`SPACE`/`ENTER` - Lock the window in the bottom corner
`X`             - Turn into a window that can be easily anchored
`Z` *while locked* - Move the window out of the way of the cursor.
`ESC`           - Close out (you can always just move your cursor to the top right corner)

If you ever want to close out, you can simple move your cursor to the top-right corner, or press *ESC* if you're focused on the window.

### `v2.1.2`

If you ever want to close out, you can simple move your cursor to the top-right corner.

You can [download the *(do not follow)* version](https://www.dropbox.com/s/24v5jzfnvhcarlj/Colorblind%20Helper%20v2.1.2%20-%20Window.exe?dl=1) if you don't like the window always following your cursor.
